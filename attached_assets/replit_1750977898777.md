# Professional Intraday Trading Assistant

## Overview

This is a comprehensive professional intraday trading assistant built with Python and Streamlit. The application provides real-time NSE/BSE stock market analysis, AI-powered signal generation, and automated alert management. It combines multiple technical indicators, machine learning models, and professional-grade charting to assist traders in making informed decisions.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend Layer**: Streamlit-based web interface with responsive design
- **Data Layer**: Real-time market data fetching using yfinance API with intelligent caching
- **Analysis Engine**: Technical indicator calculations using TA-Lib and custom algorithms
- **AI/ML Layer**: Machine learning models for signal generation using scikit-learn
- **Alert System**: Multi-channel notification system (Telegram, email, desktop)
- **Persistence Layer**: Trading journal and performance tracking with CSV/JSON export
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with environment-specific settings

The system is designed as a real-time trading dashboard that can run continuously with auto-refresh capabilities.
